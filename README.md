# Developing an app for GA's classroom-display iPads

## Timeframe

1 week

## Technologies & Tools Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Git & GitHub
- MERN Stack
- Luxon (Date-time library)
- Formik / Yup (Forms and validation)

## Description

The group chose to undertake the project (which was a current, real-life need by GA). Similar to working in team projects in the industry,the group got to meet up with the stakeholders involved and discussions/briefs/updates were communicated throughout the project's duration.

General approach for the project evolved throughout the process; initially from a "simple" read-and-display app with CRUD functions, to a more funtional Room booking app that also does the display for classrooms use/users.

## Dependencies

- ESLint
- Express-session
- Formik
- Luxon
- Yup
- React
- Vite

## User Story

- GA Administrator POV
  As an administrator of GA, I would like to have an app that can help to display what class/cohort/user is currently tagged/booked for the respective Classrooms within the premises. I would like minimal interaction with the app but would also like it to reflect any added holidays/breaks/new cohorts.

## Approach to Development

- [x] **Step 1:** Plan database schema / data structure
- [x] **Step 2:** Determine what user-inputs are necessary
- [x] **Step 3:** Come up with "forms" for the inputs (with major CRUD functions)
- [x] **Step 4:** Reproducing a table/calendar that displays informtion in the required/right format
- [x] **Step 5:** Coding the logic for table/calendar for correctly displaying the data

- [x] **Step 6** (Stretch Goals): Filter and sort functions for ease-of-use for end-user

## Issues faced during development

- The very initial hurdle was determining what the data structure of the project should be and also subsequently coming up with a database Schema that is not just sensible, but also minimal and intuitive. Reason because the end-user (GA's staff) would have to interact with the system/app. And it was communicated that they should have minimal need for interaction and it should be easy and intuitive to use.

- Finding a suitable calendar library proved to be much harder that imagined, as many could not fit the requirements for displaying in the format envisioned (and which was also communicated to the "clients") The group ended up hard-coding a table for that purpose.

- CSS of the app is not a 100% due to time constraints, but the main purpose of the app (Classroom Display) is functioning and would only need some minor tweaks if any at all (if required by GA).

## Deployment

The app is deployed on Cyclic, and you can view the app here: https://good-jade-snail-gear.cyclic.app/

## Additional Information

- The app was developed to meet real needs, and the exposure through the whole process of the development was really beneficial in helping the group understand and experience the complexities involved in even smalll projects. (Not limited to) The meeting of stakeholders, to discussions on feasibility, revisions/improvements of the app, as well as the necessary considerations for UX purposes.
